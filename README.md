Overall Project Summary : 
The purpose of this project is to create a Library Catalog Application; a desktop Java application designed to help users manage a collection of books. 
The application uses JavaFX for the graphical user interface and SQLite for managing the database.
Users can add, search, update, and delete books, with each entry containing information like the title, author, genre, and publication year. 
All data is stored locally in an SQLite database, ensuring persistence across sessions. 
This project is ideal for users who want a simple and efficient way to maintain a digital library.

First Iteration Project Summary :
This initial iteration of the Library Catalog Application sets the groundwork for a user-friendly platform that empowers avid readers and focuses on account creation, robust search capabilities, and personalized recommendations. Future iterations will build on this foundation along other user stories, introducing additional features and refinements to further enrich the user experience.
