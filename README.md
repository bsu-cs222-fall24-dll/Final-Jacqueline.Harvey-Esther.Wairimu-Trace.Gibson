Library Catalog Project - Iteration 2
This release builds on the Library Catalog project by introducing features that allow avid readers to manage their collections and track reading goals more effectively. In Iteration 2, we’ve implemented several user-requested functionalities such as notifications for New Releases. The project’s Database Management System (DBMS), implemented in the previous iteration, underpins all these features. It securely manages user data, including but not limited to reading lists, notifications, and bookmarks, ensuring seamless and efficient access across the catalog. In the next iteration, we’ll introduce a GUI to bring these features together in an interactive, user-friendly interface.

Overall Project Summary : 
The purpose of this project is to create a Library Catalog Application; a desktop Java application designed to help users manage a collection of books. 
The application uses JavaFX for the graphical user interface and SQLite for managing the database.
Users can add, search, update, and delete books, with each entry containing information like the title, author, genre, and publication year. 
All data is stored locally in an SQLite database, ensuring persistence across sessions. 
This project is ideal for users who want a simple and efficient way to maintain a digital library.
